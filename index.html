        <h2> Animal Rights</h2>
	<ul class="text-block">
		<li><a href="#">Click here to learn more</a> </li>
		<li> Animal rights is the idea that some, or all, non-human animals are entitled to the possession of their own lives and that their most basic interests—such as the need to avoid suffering—should be afforded the same consideration as similar interests of human beings. 
		Advocates oppose the assignment of moral value and fundamental protections on the basis of species membership alone—an idea known since 1970 as speciesism, when the term was coined by Richard D. Ryder—arguing that it is a prejudice as irrational as any other.They maintain that animals should no longer be viewed as property or used as food, clothing, research subjects, entertainment, or beasts of burden.</li>

        <h2> Drug Abuse</h2>
 	<ul class="text-block">
		<li><a href="#">Click here to learn more</a> </li>
		<li> Addiction is a chronic disease characterized by drug seeking and use that is compulsive, or difficult to control, despite harmful consequences. The initial decision to take drugs is voluntary for most people, but repeated drug use can lead to brain changes that challenge an addicted person’s self-control and interfere with their ability to resist intense urges to take drugs. 
		These brain changes can be persistent, which is why drug addiction is considered a "relapsing" disease—people in recovery from drug use disorders are at increased risk for returning to drug use even after years of not taking the drug.</li>
